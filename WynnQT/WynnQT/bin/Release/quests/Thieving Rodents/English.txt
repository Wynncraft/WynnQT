Farmer Kelri: ... This isn't my ring. This is a washer! The dang rodents must be in the nest! They really will eat anything.
Farmer Kelri: Maybe you could take a look in their hive for me? I know, it is a horrible place and I've been meaning to close it up.
Farmer Kelri: But the chances are the rat we're looking for is in there. Its over in the field, and don't forget to make sure my wife doesn't see you.
Farmer Kelri: Bring me [1 Wedding Ring] as soon as you take care of the rat who stole it!
Farmer Kelri: The nest is in the cave right over there.
