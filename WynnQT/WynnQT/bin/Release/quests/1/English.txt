Stage 1
Enzan: I see you want to venture into the wilderness!
Enzan: My name is Enzan, and I am now a retired knight. I've spent most of my life fighting for Ragni's army, just like you.
Enzan: I know how hard it must be to be recruit at this time, so I got something that could help you! Well, I don't have it, but my brother does!
Enzan: Follow this road, he's at the entrance of the Nivla Forest, you can't miss him.
Enzan: Tell him I sent you! He can be such a jerk to strangers sometimes...

Stage 2
Therck: Can't you see I'm busy?
Therck: Oh, my brother? Sorry, I didn't know.
Therck: Why yes, I actually have something that could help you...
Therck: This Red Powder will enchant your weapons and armor with a powerful fire magic.
Therck: To use it, put the powder and your weapon in the crafting table, in your inventory.
Therck: Now be careful while exploring this forest, few people come out alive...
